(DHCP Fundamentals Explained) Computer networks can be of any form like a LAN, WAN etc. If you are connected to a local LAN or an internet connection, the IP addresses form the basis of communication over computer networks. An IP address is the identity of a host or a computer device while connected to any network. In most of the cases when you connect your computer to a LAN or internet, you\u2019ll notice that the IP address and other information like subnet mask etc are assigned to your computer automatically. Have you ever thought about how this happens? Well, in this article we will understand the concept of DHCP that forms the basis of this functionality. 1.- What is DHCP? DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. As the name suggests, DHCP is used to control the network configuration of a host through a remote server. DHCP functionality comes installed as a default feature in most of the contemporary operating systems. DHCP is an excellent alternative to the time-consuming manual configuration of network settings on a host or a network device. DHCP works on a client-server model. Being a protocol, it has it\u2019s own set of messages that are exchanged between client and server. Understanding DHCP helps in debugging many network related problems. Read our articles on wireshark and Journey of a packet on network to enhance your understanding on network and network debugging tools. In the next section, we will cover the working of this protocol. 2. -How DHCP Works? Before learning the process through which DHCP achieves it\u2019s goal, we first have to understand the different messages that are used in the process. DHCPDISCOVER It is a DHCP message that marks the beginning of a DHCP interaction between client and server. This message is sent by a client (host or device connected to a network) that is connected to a local subnet. It\u2019s a broadcast message that uses 255.255.255.255 as destination IP address while the source IP address is 0.0.0.0 DHCPOFFER It is DHCP message that is sent in response to DHCPDISCOVER by a DHCP server to DHCP client. This message contains the network configuration settings for the client that sent the DHCPDISCOVER message. DHCPREQUEST This DHCP message is sent in response to DHCPOFFER indicating that the client has accepted the network configuration sent in DHCPOFFER message from the server. DHCPACK This message is sent by the DHCP server in response to DHCPREQUEST recieved from the client. This message marks the end of the process that started with DHCPDISCOVER. The DHCPACK message is nothing but an acknowledgement by the DHCP server that authorizes the DHCP client to start using the network configuration it received from the DHCP server earlier. DHCPNAK This message is the exact opposite to DHCPACK described above. This message is sent by the DHCP server when it is not able to satisfy the DHCPREQUEST message from the client. DHCPDECLINE This message is sent from the DHCP client to the server in case the client finds that the IP address assigned by DHCP server is already in use. DHCPINFORM This message is sent from the DHCP client in case the IP address is statically configured on the client and only other network settings or configurations are desired to be dynamically acquired from DHCP server. DHCPRELEASE This message is sent by the DHCP client in case it wants to terminate the lease of network address it has be provided by DHCP server. Now as we know about the various DHCP messages, it\u2019s time to go through the the complete DHCP process to give a better Idea of how DHCP works. Note that the steps mentioned below assume that DHCP functionality is enabled by default on the client side. Here are the steps : Step 1: When the client computer (or device) boots up or is connected to a network, a DHCPDISCOVER message is sent from the client to the server. As there is no network configuration information on the client so the message is sent with 0.0.0.0 as source address and 255.255.255.255 as destination address. If the DHCP server is on local subnet then it directly receives the message or in case it is on different subnet then a relay agent connected on client\u2019s subnet is used to pass on the request to DHCP server. The transport protocol used for this message is UDP and the port number used is 67. The client enters the initializing stage during this step. Step 2: When the DHCP server receives the DHCPDISCOVER request message then it replies with a DHCPOFFER message. As already explained, this message contains all the network configuration settings required by the client. For example, the yaddr field of the message will contain the IP address to be assigned to client. Similarly the the subnet mask and gateway information is filled in the options field. Also, the server fills in the client MAC address in the chaddr field. This message is sent as a broadcast (255.255.255.255) message for the client to receive it directly or if DHCP server is in different subnet then this message is sent to the relay agent that takes care of whether the message is to be passed as unicast or broadcast. In this case also, UDP protocol is used at the transport layer with destination port as 68. The client enters selecting stage during this step Step 3: The client forms a DHCPREQUEST message in reply to DHCPOFFER message and sends it to the server indicating it wants to accept the network configuration sent in the DHCPOFFER message. If there were multiple DHCP servers that received DHCPDISCOVER then client could receive multiple DHCPOFFER messages. But, the client replies to only one of the messages by populating the server identification field with the IP address of a particular DHCP server. All the messages from other DHCP servers are implicitly declined. The DHCPREQUEST message will still contain the source address as as the client is still not allowed to use the IP address passed to it through DHCPOFFER message. The client enters requesting stage during this step. Step 4: Once the server receives DHCPREQUEST from the client, it sends the DHCPACK message indicating that now the client is allowed to use the IP address assigned to it. The client enters the bound state during this step. 3.- The Concept of Lease With all the necessary information on how DHCP works, one should also know that the IP address assigned by DHCP server to DHCP client is on a lease. After the lease expires the DHCP server is free to assign the same IP address to any other host or device requesting for the same. For example, keeping lease time 8-10 hours is helpful in case of PC\u2019s that are shut down at the end of the day. So, lease has to be renewed from time to time. The DHCP client tries to renew the lease after half of the lease time has expired. This is done by the exchange of DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK messages. While doing all this, the client enters the renewing stage. 4.- How To Set Up A DHCP Server For Your LAN This tutorial describes how to set up a DHCP server (ISC-DHCP) for your local network. DHCP is short for \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\", it's a protocol that handles the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, default routers, and other IP parameters to client PCs that don't have a static IP address. Such computers try to find a DHCP server in their local network which in turn assigns them an IP address, gateway, etc. so that they can connect to the internet or other computers from the local network. In this short guide I will show how to set up a simple DHCP server (ISC-DHCP) on a Ubuntu system whose sole purpose is to assign IP adresses, a gateway, DNS servers, etc. to client computers from the local network that don't have a static IP address. You can use such a DHCP server in your home network, your office, etc., for example if your router doesn't come with a built-in DHCP server. If you set up such a DHCP server, please make sure you don't already have another one in your LAN as this might result in conflicts. 4.1- Preliminary Note This is the current situation: I'm using the network 10.10.10.0, subnetmask 255.255.255.0, broadcast address 10.10.10.255. My gateway to the internet is 10.10.10.2xx; on the gateway there's no DHCP server. My ISP told me the DNS servers I can use are 172.27.111.5 and 172.27.111.6 I have a pool of 30 IP addresses (10.10.10.2 \u2013 10.10.10.199) that can be dynamically assigned to client PCs and that are not already in use . 4.2 HowtoinstallDHCPserver First of all, you need to install the DHCP server, which you can do by running the following command: sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server HowtoconfigureDHCPserver Once the installation is complete, you need to assign network interfaces on which the DHCP server will serve. To do so, edit the default configuration file of the DHCP server via any text editor (I've used vim for that purpose): sudo vim /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server In the default configuration file edit the value of INTERFACESv4 and write the one you want the DHCP server to serve requests. INTERFACESv4=\"enps08\" If you have more than one interface DHCP to serve add them inside the quotes separating with spaces. INTERFACESv4=\"enps0s8 enp0s3\" Once the interface(s) is(are) assigned, you can proceed to DHCP server configuration. To configure the DHCP server edit the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file via any text editor. To do so, type the command below: sudo vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf Change the domain name and domain name servers (DNS) according to yours in the section mentioned below: option definitions common to all supported networks... option domain-name \"your_domain.com\"; option domain-name-servers ns1.your_domain.com, ns2.your_domain.com; If this DHCP server is the official DHCP server for the local network, the authoritative directive should be uncommented. authoritative; For an internal subnet configuration find the section with \"A slightly different configuration for an internal subnet.\" comment, uncomment all lines in the section and change the values according your needs. For example: subnet 10.10.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range 10.10.10.150 10.10.10.170; option domain-name-servers ns1.your_domain.com; option domain-name \"local.your_domain.com\"; option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0; option routers 10.10.10.2xx; option broadcast-address 10.10.10.255; default-lease-time 600; max-lease-time 7200; } In this configuration, we have mentioned the local domain name, DNS, IP range from which IPs will be assigned to clients, default and max lease times. Restart the DHCP server and it will start serve according to your configuration. To restart, type: systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server AssignfixedIPaddresstoclientwithspecificMACaddress If you want to assign specific IP address to specific client you can use client's MAC address to achieve that goal. This means that the fixed IP address will be assigned to the client whose MAC address is configured in the configuration file and it won't be assigned to any other client. To check MAC address on the client's machine run: ip a The output will look like the one below: eth0: mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 00:0c:29:39:c7:81 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 10.10.2xx.210/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic eth0 valid_lft 73924sec preferred_lft 73924sec inet6 2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:fe62:5d78/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute valid_lft 598sec preferred_lft 298sec inet6 fe80::f03c:91ff:fe62:5d78/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever The underlined part is the MAC address of the mentioned network adapter. To assign fixed IP address to specific MAC address, edit the vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file and add the following section (you must add different sections for different clients): host fixed-ip-client { hardware ethernet 00:0c:29:39:c7:81; fixed-address 10.10.10.250; } As you can notice we've given an IP address to the client out of the range that we configured to use the DHCP server. If you use an IP address within the IP range, DHCP server will skip that IP address to lease to clients dyamically and your IP range actually will be decreased by one IP address. After making changes in the configuration file, save it and restart the DHCP server to apply the changes. To restart type the following command: systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server To restart the network service on Ubuntu machine client command line you can run one of the following commands: sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service or sudo service network-manager restart After network service restart, if you check network configuration with ifconfig or ip command, you will see output like the one below: eth0: mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 00:0c:29:39:c7:81 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet10.10.10.250/24 brd 10.10.10.255 scope global dynamic eth0 valid_lft 73924sec preferred_lft 73924sec inet6 2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:fe62:5d78/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute valid_lft 598sec preferred_lft 298sec inet6 fe80::f03c:91ff:fe62:5d78/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever This exact output is from the client machine that we have configured to receive fixed IP address. As it's seen from output it received 10.10.10.250 IP address which we have set in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file on dhcp server. 4.4 How Can I See That My DHCP Server Is Working OK? To see if your DHCP server is working as expected, boot another PC (Windows, Linux, MAC, ...) in your LAN that doesn't have a static IP address. Wait a few seconds, and in /var/log/syslog on the DHCP server you should see that the DHCP server assigns an IP address to your PC. For example, in this excerpt of /var/log/syslog, a client PC named matze has been assigned the IP address 192.168.88.209: Sep 19 16:01:26 server1 dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:0c:76:8b:c4:16 via eth0 Sep 19 16:01:26 server1 dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 10.10.10.250 to 00:0c:76:8b:c4:16 (matze) via eth0 Sep 19 16:01:27 server1 dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:0c:76:8b:c4:16 (matze) via eth0 Sep 19 16:01:27 server1 dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 10.10.10.250 to 00:0c:76:8b:c4:16 (matze) via eth0 Sep 19 16:01:31 server1 dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:0c:76:8b:c4:16 (matze) via eth0 Sep 19 16:01:31 server1 dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 10.10.10.250 to 00:0c:76:8b:c4:16 (matze) via eth0 Sep 19 16:01:31 server1 dhcpd: Wrote 1 leases to leases file.
